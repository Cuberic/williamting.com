Title: Pelican vs Jekyll (Bootstrap)
Tags: pelican, jekyll, bootstrap, static, blog, generator, python, ruby
Status: draft

I spent the last two days creating a theme for use with [Pelican][pe] as I migrated away from Jekyll Bootstrap. The [theme][th-sv] is a close copy of [Svbtle.com][sv].

I could have done the same with Jekyll, but if I'm going to start hacking away on something I'd rather work on a Python project than Ruby. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with Ruby, but Python and Ruby overlap on the application stack and I'm pretty entrenched in the Python camp.

After working with both Jekyll and Pelican, I have to say Pelican's documentation, layout, and templating is better but at the same time I've run into quite a few bugs throughout the project.
