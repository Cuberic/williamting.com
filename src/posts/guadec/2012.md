After the initial culture shock of attending my first Linux conference (let's just say the dress code was casual), the annual GNOME conference was highly informative and productive.

## Tor: Anonymity Online â€“ Jacob Appelbaum

Jacob explained the Tor project, the necessity for network anonymity, and [onion routing][or]. Arab Spring resulted in a huge spike for Tor usage in affected countries.

At the same time, Jacob stressed the necessity for more [Tor exit relays][tor-relay] in the network. Even if you can't contribute exit relays to the Tor project, simply using Tor to browse regular websites helps the project.

## OCR Feeder - Joaquim Rocha

Given the problems with paper (accessibility, organic degradation), people want to create a digital copy of documents. While OCR engines are a great tool, but they only translate text and the end result are digital documents that have lost all of the original formatting.

Joaquim Rocha built OCR Feeder to create files that retained layout information from scanned documents using existing OCR engines. In addition, OCR Feeder recognizes image blocks and tags them as such.

- problems with paper
    - accessibility (handicap)
